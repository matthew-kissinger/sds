PORT                  = 9208
GECKOS_UDP_PORT_MIN  = 10000
GECKOS_UDP_PORT_MAX  = 20000
NODE_ENV             = production
```

### 4. Generate Public URL
```
Service â†’ Settings â†’ Networking:

this.serverHost = 'YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL';

// With your actual Railway URL:
this.serverHost = 'sds-server-production.up.railway.app';
```

### 6. Deploy Changes

git add .
git commit -m "Configure Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

- Real-time log streaming
- Search/filter capabilities
```

### Test Connection
```javascript
// Browser console at your GitHub Pages URL
// Should see connection success messages
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build Fails
```

- Verify package.json exists
- Ensure Node.js version >= 16
```

### Issue: Connection Refused
```
Solution:
- Verify PORT env var is set
- Check public domain is generated
- Ensure server started successfully
```
