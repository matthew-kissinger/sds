## üéØ How to Play

### Desktop Controls
- **W** - Move forward
- **A** - Move left  
- **S** - Move backward
- **D** - Move right
- **Shift** - Sprint (uses stamina)
- **Escape** - Pause/Resume game
- **Mouse Wheel** - Zoom in/out
- **P** - Toggle performance statistics
- **Enter** - Start game (on start screen)

### Mobile Controls üì±
- **Virtual Joystick** (bottom-left) - Move in any direction
- **Sprint Button** üèÉ (above joystick) - Hold to sprint

### Objective
Guide all 200 sheep through the golden gate into the pasture as quickly as possible!

### Strategy Tips
1. **Manage stamina wisely** - Sprint strategically to conserve energy for crucial moments
2. **Position strategically** - Get behind the flock relative to the gate
3. **Use flock dynamics** - Moving one sheep influences nearby sheep
4. **Apply gentle pressure** - Steady guidance works better than aggressive chasing
5. **Utilize boundaries** - Use fences to help funnel sheep toward the gate
6. **Time management** - Timer starts on first movement, so plan your approach
7. **Rest when possible** - Stamina regenerates faster when not moving

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Simulation won't load:**
- Ensure you're using a web server (not file:// protocol)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Three.js CDN accessibility

**Mobile controls not appearing:**
- Verify touch device detection is working
- Check that nipple.js library loads successfully
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled and no ad blockers interfere

**Poor performance:**
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings
- Close resource-intensive applications
- Try reducing browser zoom level
- Check if WebGL is properly enabled

**Timer not working:**
- Ensure localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Check for browser extensions blocking local storage
- Verify JavaScript is enabled

**Controls unresponsive:**
- Click on the game window to ensure focus
- Check for browser extensions intercepting input
- Verify no accessibility software is interfering
- On mobile, ensure touch events are not blocked

**Stamina system not working:**
- Ensure you're holding Shift or sprint button to sprint
- Check that the stamina bar is visible (game must be started)
- Verify the sheepdog is moving (stamina only drains during movement)

### Performance Tips
- **Desktop recommended** for best experience
- **Close unnecessary browser tabs** to free up memory
- **Update graphics drivers** for optimal WebGL performance
- **Use latest browser version** for best Three.js compatibility
- **Mobile**: Close background apps for better performance

### Mobile-Specific Tips
- **Landscape orientation** recommended for better control layout
- **Stable internet** required for CDN library loading
