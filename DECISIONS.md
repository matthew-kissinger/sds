# SDS · Locked Decisions

> Created during Track A of the agent development cycle (2026-04-23). These decisions were made with the human during the initial planning session and are treated as constraints by all subsequent agents. Do not re-litigate.

---

1. **Backend migrates to Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects + WebSockets.** SpacetimeDB was considered and deferred. Geckos/WebRTC and the droplet go away in Track C/G.
2. **Frontend moves to Cloudflare Pages.** GitHub Pages retires in Track F.
3. **Leaderboard moves to Cloudflare D1.** Not DO storage, not external SQLite. The 207-player SQLite dataset on the droplet gets migrated.
4. **Tick rate drops from 60Hz to 20Hz** server-side once on DO. Clients interpolate.
5. **Wire protocol becomes MessagePack over WebSocket** with delta-encoded sheep state. JSON-everywhere is out.
6. **Auth:** persistent_id (localStorage) + Worker-issued short-lived signed token. Signed with `JWT_SECRET` Workers secret.
7. **Lobby UX:** shareable invite URLs, public lobby list, host-starts, host-migration on disconnect, game-mode cycling in public rooms.
8. **Drop `framer-motion` and `stats.js`** - unused. Node engines pin to `>=22.0.0`.
9. **SpacetimeDB - not now.** Revisit for a future persistent-world project.
10. **Keep the droplet running in parallel for 30 days after DO cutover** as rollback. Track G destroys it.

## Track F - CF Pages Setup (2026-04-23)

Cloudflare Pages project `sds-frontend` created with production branch `main`. GitHub Actions workflows added: `deploy.yml` (auto-deploy on push to main via `cloudflare/pages-action@v1`) and `build-itchio.yml` (manual or tag-triggered itch.io zip builds). CF Pages `_redirects` (SPA fallback) and `_headers` (security headers) added to `public/`. DNS cutover and CNAME removal deferred to Track G after CF Pages is verified live.

**Revert procedure (14-day safety window):** Re-enable GitHub Pages in repo Settings > Pages, point source back to `gh-pages` branch or `main`/`docs` folder, update Cloudflare DNS to point `sheepdogsim.com` CNAME back to `matthew-kissinger.github.io`. The CNAME file remains in repo root until Track G.
