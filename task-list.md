- [x] Add reconnection logic for dropped connections

## Phase 2: Local Testing & UX Polish üß™

### 2.1 Single-Player Mode Verification
- [ ] Ensure existing single-player mode still works perfectly
- [ ] Verify all original features work (stamina, timer, completion)
- [ ] Test performance is unchanged in solo mode
- [ ] Confirm start screen transitions work

### 2.2 Local Multiplayer Testing
- [ ] Set up server to run on localhost:3000
- [ ] Test start screen mode selection
- [ ] Verify connection flow and error handling
- [ ] Test with 2+ browser tabs in multiplayer mode
- [ ] Verify input from one tab updates all tabs
- [ ] Test disconnect/reconnect scenarios
- [ ] Verify sheep state consistency across clients
- [ ] Test graceful fallback to single-player on connection issues

### 2.3 User Experience Testing
- [ ] Test mode switching (solo to multiplayer and back)
- [ ] Verify loading states and connection feedback
- [ ] Test error messages and recovery flows
- [ ] Measure and optimize multiplayer latency
- [ ] Test edge cases (rapid inputs, connection drops)

### 2.4 Performance Validation
- [ ] Monitor server CPU/memory usage with multiple clients
- [ ] Test with maximum player count per room
- [ ] Verify 60 FPS client performance in both modes

## Notes & Context
- **Hybrid Approach**: Keep single-player intact, add multiplayer as option

- **Server Authority**: Only multiplayer mode uses server simulation
- **Performance**: Single-player should have zero network overhead
- **Fallback**: Connection failures should redirect to single-player mode
